easy_infra.yml
==============

``easy_infra`` is a project which makes heavy use of generated code and composable container images. ``easy_infra.yml`` is the centralized
configuration to instruct those generation and composition processes. It describes which version of software to use where, how to generate the very
important ``/functions`` script (more on that in `/functions and functions.j2`_), which is what provides all of the hooking and capabilities.

Here is a ficticious ``easy_infra.yml`` that concisely demonstrates the various features that are possible::

    _anchors:
      file_extensions: &id001
      - tf
      security: &id002
        checkov:
          command: checkov -d . --download-external-modules True --skip-download --output
            json --output-file-path ${CHECKOV_JSON_REPORT_PATH}/checkov.json,
          customizations:
            CHECKOV_BASELINE: --baseline
          description: directory scan
      validation: &id003
      - command: terraform init -backend=false
        description: initialization
      - command: terraform validate
        description: validation
    commands:
      checkov:
        allow_update: False
        version: 2.2.8
        version_argument: --version
      tfenv:
        aliases:
        - tfe
        allow_filter:
        - match: exec
          position: 0
        file_extensions: *id001
        security: *id002
        validation: *id003
        version: v3.0.0
        version_argument: --version

.. note::
    Not all of these features are used in the default ``easy_infra`` images

YML Anchors and Aliases
-----------------------

Anchors and Aliases are a yml concept, and are fully supported in ``easy_infra.yml`` to support reusable components. See ``&id001`` and ``*id001`` above to see
an example. Learn more `here <https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#3222-anchors-and-aliases>`_ and `here
<https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/yaml-anchors/>`_.

Commands
--------

All of the terms under ``commands`` are the names of packages or tools, and the details of how and when they are installed are described in that
object of the ``easy_infra.yml``. In order to register a runtime hook against a command (Learn more about hooks `here <../Hooks/index.html>`_), or define
what security scans occur prior to executing, it must be defined under ``commands``.

The term ``commands`` was chosen in alignment with the `bash builtin <https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash>`_ command (see the "Command Execution"
section).

Alias
^^^^^

Certain tools have multiple ways to run them, such as by running ``kubectl`` or simply ``k``. These are (often) pointing to the exact same binary, and
if you'd like to support multiple aliases for a tool, provide a list of those aliases under ``alias`` in ``easy_infra.yml``, which will result in
``/functions`` containing an appropriate function hook for each of the aliases.


Allow filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``allow_filter`` allows you to perform security scans only for a very specific sub-command of a given command. For instance, in the above example,
we have::

    tfenv:
      allow_filter:
      - match: exec
        position: 0

This ensures that, in the generated ``tfenv`` function in ``/functions``, it will check for ``exec`` in the ``0`` position, and only if there's a
match will it continue to perform security scans as described in ``security``.

Allow update
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When projects are added to ``easy_infra`` they are automatically onboarded to our automated maintenance scripts (see ``def update`` under ``tasks.py`` for how
that works). All projects that are properly configured will be automatically updated when ``invoke update`` is run, and ``allow_update`` is a boolean field
under that command in ``easy_infra.yml`` which allows the onboarding but exemption of updates to a given project. This is sometimes done when a given project
changes how it performs releases or makes a breaking changes that we have yet to accomodate.

File extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``file_extensions`` were instituted to support the ``AUTODETECT`` function. If a command doesn't have file extensions defined, the project's
autodetect logic is unable to detect where files that relate to the command being run exist.

Security
^^^^^^^^

The backbone of this project is the ``security`` section. All of the terms underneath security define the series of security tools which will be run
every time the related command is run. An alternative ``easy_infra.yml`` would look something like this::

    commands:
      checkov:
        version: 2.2.8
        version_argument: --version
      kics:
        version: v1.5.1
        version_argument: version
      tfenv:
        aliases:
        - tfe
        allow_filter:
        - match: exec
          position: 0
        file_extensions:
        - .tf
        security:
          checkov:
            command: checkov -d . --download-external-modules True --skip-download --output
              json --output-file-path ${CHECKOV_JSON_REPORT_PATH}/checkov.json,
            customizations:
              CHECKOV_BASELINE: --baseline
              CHECKOV_EXTERNAL_CHECKS_DIR: --external-checks-dir
              CHECKOV_SKIP_CHECK: --skip-check
            description: directory scan
          kics:
            command: kics scan --type Terraform --no-progress --queries-path ${KICS_INCLUDE_QUERIES_PATH}
              --libraries-path ${KICS_LIBRARY_PATH} --report-formats json --output-path
              ${KICS_JSON_REPORT_PATH} --output-name kics --path .
            customizations:
              KICS_EXCLUDE_SEVERITIES: --exclude-severities
              KICS_INCLUDE_QUERIES: --include-queries
            description: directory scan
        version: v3.0.0
        version_argument: --version

After building ``easy_infra`` with this configuration, you should be able to expect that when you run ``tfenv exec init`` inside of an ``easy_infra`` container,
then it would run both the ``kics`` and ``checkov`` commands as described under ``kics: command: ...`` and ``checkov: command: ...``, with additional
customizations as defined under ``kics: customizations: ...`` and ``checkov: customizations: ...`` when the associated environment variables are set.

As an example, if you ran ``tfenv exec init`` and also had the ``CHECKOV_BASELINE`` environment variable set to ``/iac/.checkov.baseline`` then the
actual checkov command that would be run would be::

    checkov -d . --download-external-modules True --skip-download --output json --output-file-path ${CHECKOV_JSON_REPORT_PATH}/checkov.json,
    --baseline /iac/.checkov.baseline

.. note::
    The ``--baseline ...`` at the end was dynamically added due to the enviornment variable.

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes security scanning tools are only equipped to run against IaC which is in a certain state, such as ensuring that the IaC is formatted properly and
valid. ``validation`` is where you can specify what those are, and you can specify a list of commands to run in the specified order, prior to running the
security scanning tools.

Version
^^^^^^^

``version`` is where you can specify which versions of tool you want to include when you're buliding an ``easy_infra`` image. This is what is maintained by this
project's automated maintenance scripts, and it is parsed into build arguments which are passed into the container image building process.

Version Argument
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``version_argument`` is a way for us to describe how a command requests its version inside of ``easy_infra``. This is useful to know because we avoid running
security scans (and validation, if any is specified) when the version of a tool is being queried inside of an ``easy_infra`` container.

/functions and functions.j2
===========================

``functions.j2`` is a Jinja2 template, which is rendered into a ``functions`` script, and then copied into each ``easy_infra`` image at build time.
This all works based on the combination of this ``/functions`` file existing inside of the container, commands being run from within a shell (whether
or not you specify ``bash -c`` or not when running a container), and the ``BASH_ENV`` environment variable pointing to ``/functions``. The way that we
ensure that all commands are run inside a shell is by using ``"$@"`` in the ``easy_infra`` image ``entrypoint`` of ``docker-entrypoint.sh``.

Because ``BASH_ENV`` will ensure that ``/functions`` is loaded into the shell at initialization, and ``/functions`` contains functions which match the
name of tools which we are protecting, we can use those functions to perform security scans, arbitrary hooks, and logging prior to executing the
original command.

Ultimately, this means that when you run ``terraform`` (or some other properly defined command in `easy_infra.yml`_) inside of ``easy_infra``, it will
actually run the function "terraform", which will run the security scans, hooks, and logging, and only after evaluating the precursor logic will it
run ``command terraform`` which runs the ``terraform`` binary from the ``PATH``.
