<h1 align="center">Easy Infra[structure as Code]</h1>

easy_infra is a docker container that simplifies and secures Infrastructure as
Code deployments.

## Getting Started

In order to run your code from within the container, volume mount your files
into `/iac` and pass your command, such as `terraform validate`, as such:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/iac seiso/easy_infra terraform validate
```

## Secure by default

This container provides security features by default.  Let's say you are
looking to deploy an environment using terraform:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/iac seiso/easy_infra /bin/bash -c "terraform init && terraform validate && terraform apply"
```

What actually happens is that a security scan of your terraform code will be
run prior to executing the first `terraform` command, regardless of what it is.
If an issue is detected, it will exit with a non-zero status, preventing any
subsequent execution of `terraform`.

While it's not suggested, if you'd like to disable this behavior you have some
options:

1. Set the `SKIP_TFSEC` environment variable to `true`.

    ```bash
    docker run --env SKIP_TFSEC=true -v $(pwd):/iac seiso/easy_infra /bin/bash -c "terraform init && terraform apply"
    ```

1. Pass the `--skip-tfsec` argument to specific `terraform` commands.  This
   argument is processed by easy_infra and removed prior to passing parameters
   to the `terraform` command.

    ```bash
    docker run -v $(pwd):/iac seiso/easy_infra /bin/bash -c "terraform --skip-tfsec init && terraform apply --skip-tfsec"
    ```

## Terraform Caching

If you're working with the same terraform across multiple runs you can leverage
the cache via the following:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/iac -v $(pwd)/plugin-cache:/root/.terraform.d/plugin-cache easy_infra:latest /bin/bash -c "terraform init; terraform version"
```
